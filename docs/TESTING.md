# Testing

Everything below was run in this checkout. Where a result depends on a
credential this environment does not have, that is stated rather than implied.

## What runs without any credential

```bash
cd gateway && npm ci && npx tsc --noEmit && npm test     # 129 tests
cd web     && npm ci && npm run verify                   # build + 102 tests
```

`npm run verify` in `web/` builds first on purpose: the packaging tests read the
real `web/dist` output rather than a description of it.

Two gateway tests drive a real runtime binary and skip, saying why, when it is
not available: the Hermes subprocess test (needs `HERMES_CHECKOUT`) and the
real Claude Code test (needs `claude` installed; see below). Everything else
needs no credential, including the Anthropic and Claude Code runtime tests.

## Running the Hermes tests

The Hermes tests drive the official runtime in a real subprocess. Install it and
point the two variables at the installation:

```bash
python3 -m venv .hermes-venv
./.hermes-venv/bin/pip install hermes-agent==0.19.0
export HERMES_CHECKOUT="$(./.hermes-venv/bin/python -c 'import sysconfig;print(sysconfig.get_paths()["purelib"])')"
export HERMES_PYTHON="$PWD/.hermes-venv/bin/python"
cd gateway && npm test                                   # 128 passed, 1 skipped (Claude Code, below)
```

`HERMES_CHECKOUT` must be the directory containing `run_agent.py`; for a pip
install that is the environment's `site-packages`. The runtime talks to a local
OpenAI-compatible fixture, so no model credential is used.

Version under test: **hermes-agent 0.19.0**.

## Verifying the Anthropic runtime

`tests/managed.test.ts` drives the preserved Anthropic Managed Agents path end
to end. The gateway uses the real `@anthropic-ai/sdk`; only the far end is a
fixture that speaks the Managed Agents wire protocol over loopback, selected
with `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`. Provisioning, the session tool slate, the SSE event
drain, the custom-tool round trip, approvals and cancellation all run for real.

```bash
cd gateway && npm test -- tests/managed.test.ts           # 7 passed
```

No credential is used and nothing leaves the machine. What it establishes:

- one shared agent and environment, one vault and session per owner, and the
  model, system prompt and toolsets living on the **agent** -- a session that
  carried its own model would silently diverge from it;
- an unchanged app surface does not bump the agent version on every task;
- the hosted agent's own toolsets are forced to `always_ask`, the gateway's
  capabilities are added as custom tools, and the employee's standing
  instructions travel as the one `system.message` the API allows;
- a governed read runs and its result is returned on the tool channel, with a
  receipt stored against the run;
- a financial action stops the run at `needs_user`, tells the hosted agent
  nothing until the owner decides, and is charged only after approval;
- a declined action is never executed and the refusal is returned to the model,
  so it reports the refusal instead of inventing a delivered result;
- built-in and MCP tool confirmations are answered by policy, not by the model:
  a shell and an unlisted MCP write are denied, a listed read is allowed, and
  every decision is recorded against the run;
- an action left pending by a previous process is answered as an error and
  never replayed under a new run;
- cancelling interrupts the hosted session and closes the stream rather than
  leaving it draining;
- a missing `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` refuses before any hosted call is made.

These tests were checked by mutation: weakening the `always_ask` policy,
removing the approval gate, auto-allowing hosted built-ins and dropping the
stale-action error flag each fail exactly the test that covers them.

What this does **not** establish: that Anthropic's own service behaves as
documented, or that a real key works. That is one `deploy/doctor.sh` run away
on a machine that has one.

## Verifying the Claude Code runtime

`tests/claude.test.ts`. Claude Code runs on the owner's own Claude
subscription, so the rules under test are Anthropic's as much as ours: the
gateway never handles the login and never runs anyone else's task on it.

All but one of its checks drive a stand-in CLI
(`tests/fixtures/fake-claude.mjs`) that speaks Claude Code's stream-json
protocol and is the MCP client of the gateway's **real** bridge, socket channel
and ToolGateway. They establish:

- the command line switches off every built-in tool (`--tools ""`), loads no MCP
  server but the gateway's (`--strict-mcp-config`), refuses rather than asks
  (`--permission-mode dontAsk`, `--permission-prompts none`), and never uses
  `--dangerously-skip-permissions` or `--bare`;
- a Claude Code that reports any tool the gateway does not govern is stopped,
  and a tool call that races that startup report is refused, not run;
- a purchase waits for the owner and is charged once, after approval; a
  declined message is never sent and the refusal is returned to the model;
- only `CLAUDE_CODE_OWNER` can have tasks run on it; anyone else's task is
  refused before Claude Code starts;
- no service key, no `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` and no `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN`
  reaches it; `HOME` does, which is how Claude Code finds its own login;
- the tool channel is a Unix socket in a 0700 directory, needs the run's
  256-bit token, and is gone when the run ends;
- Claude Code's own error text (paths, keys) never reaches the phone;
- a camera still reaches it as an image block;
- the phone is told it is ready only when it is the owner's and signed in, and
  a slow sign-in check never holds up the phone's refresh.

The remaining check runs the real, unmodified `claude` binary against a fixture
Messages API on loopback, with an empty `HOME` and a fixture key:

```bash
cd gateway && npm test -- tests/claude.test.ts   # with claude on PATH, or CLAUDE_CODE_BIN set
```

It checks the startup contract (only the governed tools, the bridge
connected), then a full governed tool call through the fixture model. It skips
inside a Claude Code cloud session that has a network, because there the CLI
is bound to that session's own account and does not honour
`ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`. **What was run here**: Claude Code 2.1.282 offline
(`unshare -rn`); the startup contract passed and the model half skipped for
that reason. The full model loop against the real binary has not been run
anywhere yet; it runs on an ordinary machine, such as the server.

Removing `--tools ""` makes the real binary start with `Task`, `Bash`, `Edit`,
`Read`, `NotebookEdit`, `CronCreate`, `SendMessage` and more; the test fails and
the runtime's own startup check stops the run.

To try the owner's real login once it is signed in, `bash deploy/doctor.sh
--live` sends one tiny task. That uses a little of the plan, so plain
`doctor.sh` never does.

## Live browser and take-over

`tests/browser.test.ts` (14 checks) against a stand-in Browser Use service,
and end-to-end checks in a real browser (below). The stand-in behaves like
Browser Use's v4 API as its official SDK defines it (below): runs are created,
polled and cancelled, never paused; each belongs to a session; a follow-up run
in the session reuses its live browser. Established:

- taking over stops the employee's current run at the provider **before** the
  phone says you are in control, and that stop is not mistaken for the end of
  the task; handing back starts a follow-up run in the same session, told to
  carry on from the page as it is, with the same guard rails as the first run;
- a refused stop leaves the employee in control and says so, a refused
  follow-up leaves the browser with you, and a browser with no Browser Use
  session is never taken over, since it could not be handed back;
- stopping while you hold the browser ends the job cleanly, and stopping a run
  that had already finished is not left holding the only browser slot;
- if a follow-up run is given a different browser, the phone switches to its
  live view;
- time with the owner does not count against the employee's 15 minutes, but a
  take-over left open is ended after 45;
- the live link is dropped from the record when the job ends or is stopped;
- after a restart, every browser left open is stopped at its provider (a
  Browserbase session released, a Browser Use run cancelled) and its slot
  freed, so a new request is not held up; one the provider will not confirm
  stopped is tried once more and then let go, and a browser started since is
  never touched. The gateway does this itself on boot (mutation-checked: each
  of these fails without the code for it);
- the phone only frames https pages from Browser Use's hosts (or ones an owner
  adds with `BROWSER_LIVE_VIEW_HOSTS`, validated because they become part of
  the page policy); any other live view is named on screen, not framed, and is
  still kept for the glasses apps that already show it;
- take-over and hand-back need the session and CSRF token, and another owner's
  browser answers 404 with nothing sent to the provider;
- in the real browser: the live page loads under the app's policy with no
  violation; while the employee drives, taps on it go nowhere; once you are in
  control, taps and typing reach it; the page is loaded **once** however often
  the app re-renders; Stop cancels at the provider and lets go of the view.

**Checked against Browser Use itself** (its documentation site is blocked from
here, so through its official SDK, `browser-use-sdk` 3.11.3 on npm and PyPI,
which is generated from its API definition, and its docs as quoted by search):

- v4 is `https://api.browser-use.com/api/v4`, authenticated with
  `X-Browser-Use-API-Key`; runs are `POST /runs`, `GET /runs/{id}`,
  `/status`, `/events` and `POST /runs/{id}/cancel` -- all as the gateway
  already used them.
- **v4 has no pause or resume for a run.** The first version of take-over
  called `/pause` and `/resume`; against the real service it would have
  failed every time (safely: the employee kept the browser and the phone said
  so). It now uses what v4 does have: a session "can reuse its live browser",
  and a follow-up run with the session's id resumes work "in the same browser".
- The live view is served from `live.browser-use.com`, is meant to be framed,
  and Browser Use tells apps with a Content-Security-Policy to add it to
  `frame-src` -- which is what the app does.

**Still unconfirmed**: that the session's browser stays open between the
employee's run being stopped and the follow-up. Browser Use's session design
implies it (the browser belongs to the session, and interrupting a run is
built to continue in the same browser), but no document says it outright. If
it does not, the owner's view would lose its connection, and hand-back would
continue in a fresh browser. Whether a phone's keyboard opens inside Browser
Use's viewer is up to that viewer.

## Browserbase browser

`tests/browserbase.test.ts` runs the employee's step-by-step browser tools
against a **real headless Chromium** reached over CDP, exactly as a Browserbase
session is reached, with a stand-in for Browserbase's session API and a local
shop site. The stand-in follows Browserbase's API as its official SDK
(`@browserbasehq/sdk` 2.21.0) defines it: `POST /v1/sessions` with
`X-BB-API-Key`, `GET /v1/sessions/{id}/debug` for the live view, and
`POST /v1/sessions/{id}` with `REQUEST_RELEASE` to end it. Established:

- no browser is started until the owner approves opening one (it is a
  `computer` action), and the approval card says what for;
- the employee opens a browser, goes to a page, reads its text and controls,
  clicks, types, submits and screenshots it; the screenshot becomes an owned
  artifact; the live view is recorded for the phone but never returned to the
  model, and the API key goes to Browserbase only -- it is in no receipt,
  action or event;
- it refuses to press a button that places an order or pays, judged both by
  what it was asked to press and by the element actually hit (visible text,
  value, label, title), so a "Place order" submit input is refused too;
- it refuses to type into password fields (by type, even with an innocent
  label), one-time-code and payment autocomplete fields, and fields labelled as
  passwords, card numbers, security codes, expiry, PINs or account numbers;
- while the owner has taken the browser over, the employee's next step waits
  and sends nothing; it continues after hand-back;
- another owner's task cannot use the browser;
- stopping the task, or its finishing, releases the session at the provider
  and drops the live link;
- mutation-checked: removing the element-name check, the password-type check
  or the owner wait each makes a test fail.

End to end (below, 8 checks): opening the browser asks first; taking it over
is immediate; while the owner drives, the shop receives no requests from the
employee and its task waits rather than failing; handing back lets it finish;
every step is on the record; the answer came from the page it read; and the
session is released as soon as the task is done.

`tests/suppliers.test.ts` also covers `offer_record`: an offer read on a
website joins the supplier comparison marked as read from a website and
unverified, and checkout refuses it, since no supplier connection stands behind
it.

**Not verified here**: a live Browserbase session. This environment's network
policy blocks `api.browserbase.com`; on the server, `bash deploy/doctor.sh`
checks the key against Browserbase itself.

## Installer and doctor

`deploy/install.sh` and `deploy/doctor.sh` were run for real in a fresh clone,
with no terminal attached (as an agent runs them), against stand-ins for
systemd and Caddy. The systemd stand-in starts each unit's `ExecStart` as its
`User=`, with its `EnvironmentFile` read literally. So "gateway running" means
the gateway actually started from the unit the installer wrote and answered
`/health`. Established:

- a first run with the answers given up front installs, builds, starts the
  gateway (in production mode, with the generated `STATE_SECRET`) and adds
  the site beside an existing Caddy site;
- with the services running as an ordinary user rather than root, the gateway
  can read its own code and the built app, `data/` and `.env` stay private to
  that user, and `doctor.sh` works without sudo;
- a second run keeps the address, the runtime, the access code, the secrets
  and every setting added by hand exactly (including `$` and JSON values),
  restarts the gateway, and does not add the Caddy site twice;
- if Caddy rejects the result, its file is put back byte for byte (or, if there
  was none, none is left) and the lines to add are printed;
- `doctor.sh` reads values as systemd does and reports the Hermes model
  provider, or its absence.

Before these fixes, the same install left a gateway that could not start:
sharp's Linux binary was missing, reproduced with the installer's own `npm ci`
command.

**Not verified here**: a real VPS, real systemd, real Caddy with a real
certificate, and the voice worker's Python install (no LiveKit credentials).

## End-to-end

Drives the built PWA in Chromium against a real gateway process -- real
database, run queue, tool gateway, approval gate and Hermes subprocess. Only the
model is a fixture, so assertions are about system behaviour rather than a live
model's wording.

Chromium supplies a synthetic camera and microphone, so the capture path runs
for real: `getUserMedia`, a live preview, freeze-frame as track mute, and a
still that travels to the gateway as owned evidence. `getUserMedia` exists only
in a secure context, which `http://127.0.0.1` is, so this is the same path a
phone takes over https.

Covered: sign-in and session hardening; a governed task through the runtime;
camera capture to evidence; honest degradation with no realtime credentials;
the approval gate; watching the employee browse and taking over, with Browser
Use and with a Browserbase browser the employee drives itself; cancellation; a task surviving the page being closed
mid-flight; isolation between two signed-in owners; idempotency, CSRF and
sign-out.

```bash
cd web && npm run build
cd web && npm run e2e                                    # 119 checks
```

Needs `HERMES_CHECKOUT` and `HERMES_PYTHON` as above; it exits 2 with
instructions if they are missing. `CHROMIUM_PATH` overrides the browser binary.

The suite is timing-sensitive on a loaded machine. Of three runs here, two
passed 90/90 and one stopped at 52/53, having waited the full 150s for the
Hermes subprocess to return supplier results while other suites were running.
Nothing in the gateway or the client differed between those runs. Treat a
single timeout on a busy machine as a result to reproduce on an idle one, not
as a pass.

It happened again with the restart-recovery change. Of four runs, the two on
an idle machine passed 119/119. The two run under load stopped on a 150s wait:
once for a long task to start, right after the whole gateway suite; once for
supplier search, while installer builds ran alongside.

## Current results

| Suite | Command | Result |
|---|---|---|
| Gateway typecheck | `npx tsc --noEmit` | clean |
| Gateway tests | `npm test` | 128 passed, 0 failed, 1 skipped (129 tests); the skip is the real Claude Code test, for the reason above |
| Web typecheck + build | `npm run build` | clean; entry 38.8 kB, 13.0 kB gzipped |
| Web tests | `npm test` | 102 passed (9 files) |
| End-to-end | `npm run e2e` | 119 passed |

`npm run lint` in `gateway/` (prettier --check) fails on 38 files (the two
Browserbase files are the newest). It already
failed on 20 at the `a62fb16` checkpoint, before any of this work: the
codebase's deliberate dense style does not match its own prettier config.
Reformatting it is a separate decision, so new files follow the surrounding
style and are reported too.

## Acceptance criteria

Labels are the handoff's: **VERIFIED**, **BLOCKED ON OWNER CREDENTIAL**,
**SCAFFOLDED**, **NOT IMPLEMENTED**.

| # | Criterion | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Phone visual question through the realtime layer, spoken result | IMPLEMENTED + BLOCKED ON OWNER CREDENTIAL — camera capture, freeze and upload are verified in a browser; the realtime conversation needs LiveKit and realtime model credentials. With none configured the gateway answers 503 and the app says so instead of offering a dead control (verified) |
| 2 | Visual context → execute → gateway → runtime → governed tool → evidence | IMPLEMENTED + VERIFIED (e2e) — a still captured from a live camera through `getUserMedia` becomes an owned artifact, is attached as authorised context, and the run completes through Hermes with an evidence link |
| 3 | Long task acknowledged fast, survives disconnect, completes later | IMPLEMENTED + VERIFIED (e2e) — acknowledged while still running, the page and its whole context are closed mid-task, the task completes with no client attached, and the result is present and on screen after reconnecting |
| 4 | Cancellation prevents hidden continuation | IMPLEMENTED + VERIFIED (e2e, `core.test.ts`, `permissions.test.ts`) — stopping marks it cancelled at once, and after the model would have finished it is still cancelled with no result and no artifact |
| 5 | Hermes selection, Codex through Hermes, controlled fixture | Hermes: IMPLEMENTED + VERIFIED against the official runtime (hermes-agent 0.19.0) in a real subprocess. Codex: IMPLEMENTED + BLOCKED ON OWNER CREDENTIAL — only the credential boundary is verified (`parity.test.ts`), not the provider path |
| 6 | SMS draft / approval / send / inbound status | Contract IMPLEMENTED + VERIFIED against fixtures (`communications.test.ts`): nothing reaches the provider before approval, the approval names the exact destination and text, a changed destination is refused, an uncertain send is never retried, and inbound webhooks are signature-checked, deduplicated and framed as untrusted. Live Twilio: BLOCKED ON OWNER CREDENTIAL |
| 7 | Outbound call objective / status / transcript / outcome | Contract IMPLEMENTED + VERIFIED against fixtures (`communications.test.ts`): approval names the objective, the webhook is signature-verified, applied once across duplicates and refused when its timestamp is stale. Live Retell: BLOCKED ON OWNER CREDENTIAL |
| 8 | Multi-supplier comparison with timestamped offers | IMPLEMENTED + VERIFIED against fixtures and end to end (`suppliers.test.ts`, `offers.test.ts`, e2e): every connected supplier is searched in parallel, one failing never erases the others, offers normalize into one model, a total is withheld when a component is unquoted, and the phone names who was not included. Live supplier accounts: BLOCKED ON OWNER CREDENTIAL |
| 9 | Purchase approval blocks unauthorised checkout | IMPLEMENTED + VERIFIED (`permissions.test.ts`) — a decision is bound to the exact arguments, "always allow" is refused for financial effects, and cancelling during checkout preflight prevents the order |
| 10 | Unauthorised access returns 403/404 without leaking | IMPLEMENTED + VERIFIED (e2e two-owner run, `http.test.ts`, `security.test.ts`) — a second signed-in owner sees none of the first's records, gets 404 for their task and artifact content, and cannot cancel their task |
| 11 | Reconnect does not duplicate messages, calls or purchases | IMPLEMENTED + VERIFIED for run submission (idempotency key, e2e), for uncertain external effects (`permissions.test.ts`), for message sends (`communications.test.ts`: the provider is called once and never again on its own), and for the event stream (`realtime.test.ts`: reconnect resumes from the last event rather than replaying). Duplicate suppression against a live provider: BLOCKED ON OWNER CREDENTIAL |
| 12 | Phone fully usable without glasses | IMPLEMENTED + VERIFIED — the PWA has no glasses dependency; the whole e2e run is a phone viewport with a phone user agent |

### Adapters

| Adapter | Status |
|---|---|
| Hermes runtime | IMPLEMENTED + VERIFIED against the official runtime in a subprocess |
| Claude Code (owner's subscription) | IMPLEMENTED + VERIFIED against a stand-in CLI through the real bridge and gateway (11 checks); startup contract VERIFIED with the real binary offline. Full model loop with the real binary: not yet run anywhere (runs on the server) |
| Anthropic Managed Agents | IMPLEMENTED + VERIFIED end to end against a protocol fixture over loopback (`managed.test.ts`, 7 checks): provisioning shape, governed tool slate, approval gate, refusal, policy-answered confirmations, stale-action handling and cancellation. Live Anthropic account: BLOCKED ON OWNER CREDENTIAL |
| Twilio SMS | Contract VERIFIED against fixtures; live account BLOCKED ON OWNER CREDENTIAL |
| Retell voice | Contract VERIFIED against fixtures; live account BLOCKED ON OWNER CREDENTIAL |
| Home Depot / Lowe's / Amazon / Walmart | Adapter, mapping, fulfillment and failure handling VERIFIED against fixtures; live accounts BLOCKED ON OWNER CREDENTIAL |
| Local and specialty suppliers | VERIFIED — configured through `SUPPLIER_CONFIG_PATH` and exercised end to end against a live local endpoint |
| eBay | Optional only; VERIFIED that it is not constructed unless `EBAY_ENABLED=true`, even with credentials present. Live account BLOCKED ON OWNER CREDENTIAL |
| Browser Use | Approval gate, unconfigured refusal, cancel, cleanup and cross-owner safety VERIFIED; live view and take-over VERIFIED against a stand-in service in a real browser. The v4 pause/resume paths and live-view host are unconfirmed against the live service; live account BLOCKED ON OWNER CREDENTIAL |
| MCP connectors | Config handling, https-only, owner scoping, credential requirement and the checkout-tool prohibition VERIFIED; a live connector BLOCKED ON OWNER CREDENTIAL |
| Deployment packaging | IMPLEMENTED + VERIFIED locally — the gateway serves the built PWA, warns when it is missing, and `/health` stays up. The container image is NOT built here: this sandbox has a docker client but no daemon |

## What no test here can establish

Live camera, microphone and realtime conversation need a real phone and
configured credentials. Every provider integration is exercised against a
fixture, which proves the contract the gateway enforces, not that the provider
behaves as documented. The container image is not built here: this sandbox has a
docker client but no daemon.
